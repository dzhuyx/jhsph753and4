JHSPH 754 Assignment 1
=======================


1. From [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) do exercises Ex 3.5, Ex 3.6. 

2. * Show that  if the p-values of the $m_0$ null hypotheses are independent then $\frac{V(t)}{t} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m_0} 1(p_i \leq t)}{t}$ for $0 \leq t \leq 1$ is a martingale with time running backward with respect to the filtration $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(1\{p_i \leq s\}, t \leq s \leq 1,i=1,\ldots,m)$, in other words for $s \leq t$ we have $E[V(s)/s | \mathcal{F}_t] = V(t)/t$. 
*  Show that the random variable $T_{\alpha}(\widehat{FDR}(t))$ is a stopping time with respect to $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(1\{p_i \leq s\}, t \leq s \leq 1,i=1,\ldots,m)$. 
* Show that the martingale $\frac{V(t)}{t}$ stopped at $T_{\alpha}(\widehat{FDR}(t))$ is bounded by $\frac{m}{\alpha}$.
