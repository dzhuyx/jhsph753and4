Final Project
--------------

Assigned: Thursday, February 27th
Due: Friday, March 14th

You are to create a [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) tutorial on an advanced statistical method. I will make a list of acceptable methods. Your tutorial should:

* Introduce the basic idea
* Help the user understand the properties with simple examples
* Show at least one real data example
* Describe the potential issues with using this method 

### Acceptable methods

* __Text data cleaning with regular expressions__
* __Clustering (hierarchical/k-means/etc.)__
* __Matrix decomposition (taken) (PCA/SVD/etc.)__
* __Generalized linear models (Poisson/Logistic special cases)__
* Generalized estimating equations
* __Mixed effects models__
* Quantile regression
* Generalized additive models
* Kernel smoothing
* Proportional hazards regression
* The boostrap
* Bagging
* Boosting
* __Multiple testing__
* Classification and regression trees
* Prediction study design (test/training sets/cross validation)
* Random forests
* __Linear discriminant analysis__
* Cross validation 
* __Automated model selection (AIC, BIC,etc.)__
* __Regularized regression (ridge regression, lasso, etc.)__
* Expectation maximization algorithm
* __Directed acyclic graphs for causal inference__
* Principal strata 
* Multiple imputation for missing data
* Any other idea you have
